## Scrum Methodology

We are following the **Scrum** methodology to build the LinkedUp platform incrementally, allowing for flexibility and continuous improvement.

### **Roles**
- **Product Owner**: Manages the product backlog, prioritizes tasks based on stakeholder feedback, and ensures the team focuses on delivering user-centric features.
- **Scrum Master**: Facilitates Scrum practices, resolves blockers, and ensures the team adheres to the Scrum framework.
- **Development Team**: All team members contribute to developing and delivering functional increments in each sprint.

### **Artifacts**
- **Product Backlog**: A comprehensive, prioritized list of features and improvements for the LinkedUp platform, reflecting the requirements in the SRS and SDS documents.
- **Sprint Backlog**: A set of tasks selected from the product backlog for each sprint, organized into actionable items.
- **Increment**: A working, tested version of the product, showcasing progress at the end of each sprint.

### **Events**
- **Sprint Planning**: At the start of each sprint, the team selects high-priority items from the product backlog. Tools like **Trello** are used to organize and manage the sprint backlog.
- **Daily Standups**: Brief daily meetings, either in-person or online, to discuss progress, challenges, and coordinate on tasks.
- **Sprint Review**: At the end of each sprint, the team presents the increment to stakeholders for feedback, ensuring alignment with expectations.
- **Sprint Retrospective**: A meeting to evaluate what went well, identify areas for improvement, and set actionable goals for the next sprint. Tools like **Miro** are used for visualizing insights and collaborative feedback.

### **How We Implement Scrum in the LinkedUp Project**
1. **Product Backlog Creation**: The product backlog is managed on **Trello**, where all features from the SRS and SDS documents are documented and prioritized. The Product Owner continuously updates and prioritizes tasks based on user needs and project goals.
2. **Sprint Planning and Sprint Backlog**: During sprint planning, the team selects tasks for the sprint backlog. Each feature is broken down into smaller, manageable subtasks to ensure clarity and facilitate progress tracking.
3. **Daily Standups**: Team members briefly share updates on completed tasks, upcoming tasks, and any blockers they encounter, ensuring transparency and coordinated efforts.
4. **Increment Delivery**: At the end of each sprint, a functional increment of the platform is delivered, with completed features tested and ready for stakeholder review.
5. **Review and Retrospective**: After each sprint, the team demonstrates the increment in a review meeting to gather feedback. The retrospective follows to discuss successes, challenges, and improvements for the next sprint, ensuring a cycle of continuous improvement.
